# Introduction to Objects

Object is another datastructure in JavaScript which helps to store data in `key: value` pair format which is known as property separated by comma

We can create an empty object using object literal `{}`

```js
const kiran = {
	firstName: "Kiran",
	lastName: "Bansode",
	age: 2022 - 1995,
	job: "teacher",
	friends: ["Meera", "Heera", "Jeera"],
};
```

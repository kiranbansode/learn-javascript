# Reviewing Functions

Three different ways of writing functions, but they all work in a similar way, receive input data, transform data and then output data

## Function Declaration

Function that can be used before it's declared

```js
function calcAge(birthYear) {
	return 2022 - birthYear;
}
```

## Function Expression

Essentially a function value stored in a variable

```js
const calcAge = function (birthYear) {
	return 2022 - birthYear;
};
```

## Arrow Function

Great for a quick one-line functions. Has no this keyword

```js
const calcAge = (birthYear) => 2022 - birthYear;
```

# Dot vs. Bracket Notation

There are two way to access information or data from object.

## Dot . notation

```js
const kiran = {
	firstName: "Kiran",
	lastName: "Bansode",
	age: 2022 - 1995,
	job: "teacher",
	friends: ["Meera", "Heera", "Jeera"],
};
console.log(kiran.lastName);
```

## Bracket [ ] notation

```js
const kiran = {
	firstName: "Kiran",
	lastName: "Bansode",
	age: 2022 - 1995,
	job: "teacher",
	friends: ["Meera", "Heera", "Jeera"],
};
console.log(kiran["lastName"]);
```

With the bracket notation we can also look for computed properties

```js
const kiran = {
	firstName: "Kiran",
	lastName: "Bansode",
	age: 2022 - 1995,
	job: "teacher",
	friends: ["Meera", "Heera", "Jeera"],
};

cosnt lastName = 'Name'
console.log(kiran["last" + lastName]);
```

## Add new properties using Dot . and bracket [ ] notation

We can also add new properties using dot `.` and bracket `[ ]` notions

```js
kiran.location = "India";
kiran["instagram"] = "_kiran.bansode_";
```

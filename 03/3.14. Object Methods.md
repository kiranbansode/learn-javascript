# Object Methods

Object methods are the functions which we pass as a value to object's key and access them with dot . or bracket [] notations

We can also access other properties values within object with the help of `this` keyword

```js
const kiran = {
	firstName: "Kiran",
	lastName: "Bansode",
	getfullName: function () {
		return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
	},
};

kiran.getfullName();
kiran["getfullName"]();
```

# Values and Variables

Values are piece of information or data.

Variables are like empty boxes(space in real memory) where we stores values for letter use.

Use `let` to declare a variable.

## Rules to declare variables

1. use `camelCase` naming convection for variable wherever possible.
2. Don't write varible name starting with numbers.
3. Only `$` and `_` sign is allowed
4. Don's use JavaScript's `Reserved Keywords`.
5. Don't start variable name with an Upper-Case letter.
6. Use all `CAPITAL_LETTERS` for constants.

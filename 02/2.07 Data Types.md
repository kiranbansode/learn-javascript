# Data Types

In JavaScript a value is either object or primitive

## The 7 Primitive Data Types

| Type           | What we put ?                                                     | What is the use ?              | Example                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Numbers        | Floating point numbers                                            | Used for decimals and integers | `let age = 23;`           |
| String         | Sequence of characters                                            | Used for Text                  | `let firstName = 'Kiran'` |
| Boolean        | Logical type that can only be `true` or `false`                   | Used for taking decisions      | `let fullAge = true`      |
| Undefined      | Value taken by a varialble that is not yet definded (emply value) |                                | `let children;`           |
| Null           | Also means 'empty value'                                          |                                |                           |
| Symbol(ES2015) | Value that is unique and cannot be changed                        |                                |                           |
| BigInt(ES2020) | Larger integers than the Number type can hold                     |                                |                           |

JavaScript has `Dynamic Typing`: We do not have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable, instead data types are determined automatically.

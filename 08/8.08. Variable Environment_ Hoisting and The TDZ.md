# Variable Environment - Hoisting and The TDZ(Temporal Dead Zone)

## Hoisting

Makes some types of variables accessible/usable in the code before they are acually declared. 'Variabls lifted to the top of their scope'

Before execution, code is scanned for variable declarations, and for each variable, a new property is created in the variable environment object.

| ------------------------------ | ------- | --------------------------------------- | -------- |
| function declaration           | YES     | Actual function                         | Block    |
| var variables                  | YES     | undefined                               | Function |

## TDZ, let and const

### Why TDZ ?

1. Makes it easier to avoid and catch errors : access variables before declaration is bad practice and should be avoided
2. Makes const variables actually work

### Why Hoisting ?

1. Using functions before actual declaration
2. `var` hoisting is just a byproduct

## Execuation Context

1. Variable Environment
2. Scope Chain
3. `this` Keyword

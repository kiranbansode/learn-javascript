# The `this` Keyword

`this` keyword/variable: Special variable that is created for every execution context(every function). Takes the value of (point to) the 'owner' of the function in which the `this` keyword is used.

`this` is **NOT** static, it depends on how the function is called, and its value is only assigned when the function is actually called.

1. Method 👉🏻 `this` = Object that is calling the method
2. Simple function call 👉🏻 `this` = `undefined` _[ In strict mode! Otherwise: `window` (in the browser)]_
3. Arrow function 👉🏻 `this` = `this` of surrounding function (lexical `this`) _[Arrow functions does **not** get own `this`]_
4. Event listener 👉🏻 `this` = DOM element that the handler is attached to
5. new, call, apply, bind 👉🏻 = ...soon

`this` does **NOT** point to the function itself, and also **NOT** the its variable environment

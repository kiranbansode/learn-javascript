# Hoisting and TDZ in Practice

Variables declared with `let` and `const` does not create properties on window object, but variables declared with `var` can create properties on window object.

If variables declared by `var` was accessed before initialization they will return `undefined`, but with `let` and `const` they will throw an error.

functions which was created using `function declaration` syntax will execute without any error, but with `arrow function` and `function expression` they will throw an error if invoked before creation.

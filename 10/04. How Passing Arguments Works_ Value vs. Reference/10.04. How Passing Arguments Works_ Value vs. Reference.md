# How Passing Arguments Works Value vs. Reference

## Pass by Value

It is apply to primitive types(`string`,`int`,`char`).

In Pass by value, parameters passed as an `arguments` create its own copy.

So any changes made inside the function is made to the `copied value` not to
the original value .

## Pass by Reference

It is apply on non-primitives data type(`array`, `object`).

In JavaScript, array and object follows pass by reference property.

In Pass by reference, parameters passed as an arguments `does not create` its own copy, it refers to the original value so changes made inside function affect the original value.
